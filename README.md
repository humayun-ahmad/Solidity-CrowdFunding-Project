# 🚀 Solidity CrowdFunding Project

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built on **Ethereum** using **Solidity**. This project demonstrates how to create, manage, and contribute to campaigns in a trustless environment using smart contracts.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a basic crowdfunding platform using Ethereum blockchain technology. It allows users to:

* Launch fundraising campaigns
* Contribute securely to campaigns
* Withdraw funds upon successful completion
* Validate contract functionality via tests

---

## ✨ Features

* 🏗️ **Campaign Creation**: Users can create campaigns with funding goals and deadlines.
* 💸 **Secure Contributions**: Donors can contribute ETH to campaigns.
* 🔓 **Fund Withdrawal**: Campaign owners can withdraw funds after meeting the goal.
* ✅ **Unit Testing**: Includes tests to ensure contract correctness and reliability.

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🔨 Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 🧪 Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### 🚀 Deploy Contracts
